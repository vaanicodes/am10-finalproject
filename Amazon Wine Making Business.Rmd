The observation that the top five wine-consuming countries are in Europe, and three of the top five wine-producing countries are also European, highlights the significance of Europe in the global wine industry. This makes Europe a strategic focus area for setting up a wine-making business.

The forecasted revenue trends in the European wine market are showing a pattern of growth, indicating a promising landscape for establishing a wine-making business. This positive outlook is further supported by trade data, which reveals that Italy, France, and Spain are leading in terms of both the volume of wine trade and the revenue generated from it. These countries, renowned for their rich wine-making heritage, not only dominate the European market but also have significant global influence in the wine industry.

# Product Differentiation

## Quality Analysis

We will nalyze datasets for both red and white wines to identify key factors that influence wine quality, such as acidity, sugar content, and pH levels. Understanding these variables will guide us in selecting the most suitable regions for establishing vineyards. The selection process will heavily consider regional weather conditions, crucial for wine production, as different grape varieties require specific climatic conditions. By matching the ideal environmental parameters for each type of grape with the appropriate climate data, we can pinpoint the best locations for vineyards. This data-driven and strategic approach aims to optimize wine quality by aligning grape cultivation with the most favorable environmental conditions, thereby maximizing the potential of Amazon's wine-making venture.

```{r}

# Loading & Cleaning the datasets
red_wine <- read_csv(file = "wineQualityReds.csv")
white_wine <- read_csv(file = "wineQualityWhites.csv")
red_wine <- red_wine %>% select(-...1)
white_wine <- white_wine %>% select(-...1)

```


### Factors in correlation with Red Wine Quality

```{r}
# Calculating the correlation matrix
correlation_matrix <- cor(red_wine)

# Melting the correlation matrix for plotting
melted_correlation_matrix <- melt(correlation_matrix)

# Plotting the correlation matrix with lighter color scheme
ggplot(data = melted_correlation_matrix, aes(x=Var1, y=Var2, fill=value)) +
  geom_tile() +
  geom_text(aes(label=sprintf("%.2f", value)), color="black", size=3) +
  scale_fill_gradient2(low = "lightblue", high = "pink", mid = "white", 
                       midpoint = 0, limit = c(-1,1), space = "Lab", 
                       name="Pearson\nCorrelation") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, vjust = 1, hjust = 1)) +
  labs(title = "Correlation Matrix of Red Wine Attributes", x = "", y = "")
```

The top factors most strongly correlated with red wine quality in this dataset are:

1. Alcohol (Correlation: 0.48)
2. Volatile Acidity (Correlation:-0.39)
3. Sulphates (Correlation: 0.25)
4. Citric Acid (Correlation: 0.23)

### Factors in correlation with White Wine Quality

```{r}
# Calculating the correlation matrix
correlation_matrix <- cor(white_wine)

# Melting the correlation matrix for plotting
melted_correlation_matrix <- melt(correlation_matrix)

# Plotting the correlation matrix with lighter color scheme
ggplot(data = melted_correlation_matrix, aes(x=Var1, y=Var2, fill=value)) +
  geom_tile() +
  geom_text(aes(label=sprintf("%.2f", value)), color="black", size=3) +
  scale_fill_gradient2(low = "lightblue", high = "pink", mid = "white", 
                       midpoint = 0, limit = c(-1,1), space = "Lab", 
                       name="Pearson\nCorrelation") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, vjust = 1, hjust = 1)) +
  labs(title = "Correlation Matrix of White Wine Attributes", x = "", y = "")
```


The top factors most strongly correlated with white wine quality in this dataset are:

1. Alcohol (Correlation: 0.44)
2. Density (Correlation:-0.31)
3. Chlorides (Correlation: -0.21)
4. Volatile Acidity (Correlation: 0.23)


Analyzing the factors most strongly correlated with wine quality for both red and white wines, and considering the climatic and geographical conditions of Spain, Italy, and France, we can suggest potential regions for setting up a vineyard that aligns with these quality determinants.

The rising trend in e-commerce for alcohol, with projections indicating continued growth, presents a significant opportunity. Amazon, with its robust e-commerce capabilities, is well-positioned to capitalize on this market. Notably, the highest e-commerce values for alcohol are seen in China, the US, Japan, the UK, and South Korea. This observation is intriguing, especially considering that while European countries are among the largest consumers and producers of wine, they lag in e-commerce sales for this category.

This gap in the European market represents a strategic opportunity for Amazon. By entering this relatively underserved e-commerce sector for wine in Europe, Amazon can leverage its established e-commerce strengths to create a niche. This move could be particularly impactful in creating product differentiation in highly competitive markets like the UK. By offering a unique and convenient online wine purchasing experience, Amazon can distinguish itself from local competitors and establish a strong foothold in the European market. The combination of Amazon's e-commerce expertise and the rich wine heritage of Europe could be a recipe for success, tapping into new consumer segments and driving growth in the online alcohol sales sector.
